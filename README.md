OntoEvents is an ontology designed to model events and their related entities. It provides classes and properties to represent:

Extracted subjects and objects from text (Named Entities).

Predicates linking entities within event triples.

Temporal metadata (date, hour, timestamp).

Source context such as tweets or documents.

The ontology can be used for event extraction, semantic enrichment of social media data, disaster response monitoring (e.g., earthquakes), and knowledge graph construction.
